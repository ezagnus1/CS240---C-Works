This assignment is similar to Assignment 5.  The difference is that in this assignment you will define and implement a subclass of the Map ADT (defined in mapInterface.h) using a binary search tree as the data structure.

As in Assignment 5 add the following method:

    void displayAll() const; 
    // write contents of the Map in ascending order of key to cout

Also add the following method:

    int height() const;
    // return the height of the binary search tree
The .tar.gz file you submit should contain mapInterface.h, map.h, map.cpp, testMap.cpp and a makefile.  The Map class code that you submit will be tested using your test program and by a test program written by the instructor.
