===========================

Write a C++ program that prompts the user for the name of a text file, opens that file, reads the file and stores the lines of the file in a vector of strings.  
The program should output the number of non-blank lines in the file, the average number of words per non-blank line and the average number of alphabetic characters 
per word.  A word is defined as any sequence of non-white space characters which contains at least one alpha character.
